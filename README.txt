Hello,

This is a Unrolled Linked List Data Structure
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrolled_linked_list)

It's better than the traditional linked list in the sense that it provides
less memory overhead and better cache performance if used well.

We have given all the typical linked list functionality, as well as some
index searching, which is not completely linear.

Removal is however, expensive, since we try to maintain the invariants of
the structure.

More details and comments on implementation details and client responsibilities
are given in unrolled-list.h
