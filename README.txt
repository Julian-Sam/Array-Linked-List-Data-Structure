Hello Readers:

At the moment, this is a work in progress, I guarantee that nothing works at the moment. Feel free to add stuff, thats what github's for :)


I am making a linked list of array elements, with the purpose of imitating array behaviour in terms of insertion and deletion. This should improve memory utilization in some special applicatiosn where contiguous memory blocks are needed, but exactly how much is needed is variable.
