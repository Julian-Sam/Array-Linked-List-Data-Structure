Hello,

This is a Unrolled Linked List Data Structure
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrolled_linked_list)

It's better than the traditional linked list since it provides
less memory overhead and better cache performance if used well.

We have given all the typical linked list functionality, as well as some
index searching, which is not completely linear.

Removal is however, expensive, since we try to maintain the invariants of
the structure.

Make sure to typedef define the type elem that your linked list should contain.
A sample can be found commented in line 3 of unrolled-list.h in line 3.
